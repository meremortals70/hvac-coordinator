"""Actuation.

Turns a decision into service calls. The decision itself is made in `modes.py`;
nothing here chooses what should happen, only how it is carried out.

WHAT IS CALLED AND WHY
----------------------
**Climate — standard `climate.*` services only.** Versatile Thermostat exposes
no service for setting a temperature; its own `services.yaml` covers presence,
safety, regulation modes and presets, and the setpoint goes through the
standard `climate.set_temperature`. Using the standard services means this
works identically against a Versatile Thermostat wrapper or a bare
manufacturer entity, which is what keeps Layer 3 indifferent to Layer 1.

Every call is checked against the entity's advertised capabilities first. An
HVAC mode the unit does not support, or a fan mode it does not have, is a
rejection recorded in the trace rather than a service call that errors.

**Covers — standard `cover.set_cover_position`.** This integration owns cover
decisions; it does not delegate them. Sun geometry is worked out in `sun.py`
from the window direction and the sun's position, so there is nothing to hand
off to.
