"""Mode evaluation and actuator selection.

Pure. One function decides the mode, one decides the actuator step, and both
write their reasoning into the trace as they go. Nothing here talks to Home
Assistant, so the whole decision path is testable without a running instance.

PRECEDENCE — architecture proposal v0.3, section 4
--------------------------------------------------
    LOCKOUT        beats everything, always
    PRECONDITION   beats presence, which is the point of it. Entered by a
                   heading-home request, and driven to the occupied band
    PRECOOL        free/cheap window plus forecast heat ahead
    COAST          model says the band holds unaided, and the window permits it
    SLEEP          sleep schedule and presence
    OCCUPIED       presence
    UNOCCUPIED     no presence

COAST is returned as the mode but carries base_mode, so the band that applies
is the one the displaced occupancy mode would have used. Without that, COAST
would have no band and the fallback out of COAST would have nothing to compare
against.
