"""Home Comfort Index (HCI).

Pure functions. This module imports nothing from Home Assistant so it can be
unit tested on its own.

WHAT THE INDEX IS
-----------------
HCI is the Steadman shaded apparent temperature with wind set to zero:

    AT = Ta + 0.33 * e - 0.70 * ws - 4.00          (Steadman / BoM, shade)
    e  = (RH / 100) * 6.105 * exp(17.27 * Ta / (237.7 + Ta))

Indoors ws = 0, so:

    HCI = Ta + 0.33 * e - 4.00

Ta is indoor dry bulb in degrees C, RH is indoor relative humidity in percent,
e is water vapour pressure in hPa.

WHY AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ARE NOT ENOUGH
------------------------------------------------
A person in a room exchanges heat four ways: conduction and convection to the
air, evaporation of sweat, and **radiant exchange with the surfaces around
them**. Ta and RH describe the first two. They say nothing about the third.

Sun coming through glass is radiant. It warms the person and the floor and the
desk directly, and only slowly warms the air. So a room can read 24 C on a wall
sensor while someone sitting in it is uncomfortably hot, and the air-only index
will insist they are fine.

A blind reduces this. It does not remove it. A 50% blind passes roughly half
the radiant load, which is why "the blind is down" is not the same as "there is
no solar gain".

Still air matters for the same reason in reverse. Steadman's wind-zero case
still assumes the small air movement of a normally ventilated room. A room with
the fan off, the door shut and the windows closed has less than that, so both
convective and evaporative loss are worse than the formula assumes.

The corrections below are physically motivated and approximately scaled. They
are not measured against any particular room, and they are the part of this
module most likely to need adjusting against how a room actually feels.

WHY THIS FORMULA AND NOT HEAT INDEX OR HUMIDEX
----------------------------------------------
Both of those are undefined below roughly 26-27 C. The sleep band is 18-20, so
they cannot express it. Steadman AT is continuous across the whole range this
house operates in and collapses toward dry bulb as the air dries out.

The -4.00 constant is kept so the scale matches the convention the BoM feed
already uses. It is a constant offset: it shifts every HCI number by the same
amount and changes no decision. The band defaults are set against this scale.

DO NOT COMPARE HCI TO THE BoM OUTDOOR APPARENT TEMPERATURE.
The outdoor figure carries a wind term and is a different quantity.
