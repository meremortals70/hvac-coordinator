"""Demand forecast.

Pure. No Home Assistant imports.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
The controller publishes what it expects the air conditioning to draw over a
horizon, broken down by tariff window. **It never writes battery actuators.**

Two reasons, the second stronger than the first.

Two writers on one actuator fail silently: if this controller sets a battery
reserve and another automation overwrites it four minutes later, nothing errors
— the battery simply behaves oddly.

And battery control is vendor-specific. Different manufacturers expose
different primitives with incompatible semantics. Coding one in would tie this
project to one brand.

So the output carries **no vendor concepts at all**: projected kWh over a
horizon, plus a per-window breakdown and the constraints in force. Whoever owns
the battery translates that into their own primitives.

WHAT IT IS NOT
--------------
Not a billing model and not an optimiser. It answers one question — roughly how
much energy is the air conditioning going to want, and when — accurately enough
for another system to decide what to hold in reserve.
