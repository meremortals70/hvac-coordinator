"""Thermal model.

Pure. No Home Assistant imports.

WHAT IT LEARNS
--------------
Per room, from observation, four coefficients:

    k_loss      how fast the room drifts toward outdoor conditions, per hour
    k_solar     how much the sun raises the room when it is on the glass
    k_sensible  how fast the compressor moves dry-bulb temperature, per hour
    k_latent    how fast dry mode moves humidity, per hour

**Sensible and latent are learned separately, and that is the whole point.**
A model built for a heating climate learns heat loss, heating power and solar
gain — all sensible terms — because northern-hemisphere heating has no latent
component worth modelling. A humid subtropical climate does. Rain is the case
that separates them: dry bulb falls while humidity climbs toward saturation, so
sensible load drops as latent load rises, and a filter fitting one coefficient
to both is wrong on exactly those days.

HOW IT LEARNS
-------------
A scalar Kalman update per coefficient. Each observation is an interval: what
the room did, against what the model predicted it would do. The residual is
attributed to whichever coefficient was driving over that interval, weighted by
how strongly it was driving.

Full matrix estimation is not used. The coefficients are near-independent over
short intervals — heat loss acts when the compressor is off, compressor gain
acts when it is on — so the cross terms a matrix filter would estimate are
mostly noise, and a scalar filter per coefficient is both easier to reason
about and easier to test.

CONVERGENCE
-----------
Each coefficient carries its own variance and sample count. A coefficient is
converged when it has enough samples and its variance has fallen far enough.
Until every coefficient the caller needs has converged, predictions are refused
and the caller falls back to hysteresis.

**The system works on day one and improves**, rather than needing a training
period before it does anything.
